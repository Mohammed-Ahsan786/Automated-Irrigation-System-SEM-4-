## ‚ö†Ô∏èDISCLAIMER‚ö†Ô∏è
**Listen up, folks!** This automated irrigation system using esp8266 and blynk software will get you **FULL MARKS** in your project and is **NO JOKE**ü•∏. I am **NOT RESPONSIBLE** for any **FLOODED GARDENS**, **DROWNED PLANTS**, or **ANGRY NEIGHBOURS** who blame you for their ruined lawn. If you're not sure what you're doing, please do some research before attempting to set up this system.

If you're concerned about your plants becoming too hydrated, or your sprinkler system developing a mind of its own and flooding your entire yard, or accidentally creating a new aquatic species in your backyard, then maybe this project isn't for you And if you try to blame me for any mishaps or malfunctions, **I'll just have to laugh at you HARD while sipping my lemonade from the comfort of my perfectly watered backyard**.üè°

So, **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**, and remember, **with great watering power comes great responsibility**. **BOOM! goes the sprinkler system**. Happy Gardening and acing your project!‚úåüèª 

## Overview
The Automated Irrigation System is a smart solution that helps automate the process of watering plants. It utilizes an ESP8266 and Blynk software to control the watering process. The system incorporates humidity, temperature, and soil moisture sensors that enable it to monitor the plant's environment in real-time.

The Blynk app and website provide real-time humidity, temperature, and soil moisture readings and graphs for each of the readings, allowing users to keep track of their plant's growth and health. Additionally, the system features two buttons/switches. The first is the Water button, which activates the pump and waters the plant. The second is the Automation button, which automatically waters the plant when the soil moisture goes below a predefined threshold value.

The Automation button also sends notifications when the system turns the water pump on or off, allowing users to monitor the watering process even when they're away. With this system, users can ensure their plants receive the necessary moisture and stay healthy without having to worry about manual watering.
