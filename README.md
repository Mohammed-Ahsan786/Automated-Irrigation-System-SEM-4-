## Overview

The Automated Irrigation System is a project that aims to help you automate the watering process of your plants. This project uses an ESP8266 and Blynk software to control the watering process. The system measures the soil moisture level using a soil moisture sensor and compares it to a predefined threshold level. If the soil moisture level is below the threshold, the system activates the water pump and waters the plants.

## Prerequisites

Arduino IDE installed on your computer
Blynk app installed on your smartphone
